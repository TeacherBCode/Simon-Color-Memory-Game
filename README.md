<br>
Simon is a memory game that challenges you to repeat a sequence of flashing colored lights. 
<br>
The game starts with just one color, and with each successful round, another color is added to the sequence, making it progressively harder to remember and repeat the pattern. 
<br>
If you press the wrong button or miss a color, the game ends!
Game Over:
