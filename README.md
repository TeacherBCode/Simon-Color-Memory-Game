# Simon-Color-Memory-Game
Simon shows you colors one at a time. Remember the colors of each level and press the color buttons in the same order to win!

Simon is a memory game that challenges you to repeat a sequence of flashing colored lights. The game starts with just one color, and with each successful round, another color is added to the sequence, making it progressively harder to remember and repeat the pattern. If you press the wrong button or miss a color, the game ends!
